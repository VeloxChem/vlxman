# UV/vis absorption/emission

## Generalized eigenvalue equation

The standard method to calculate UV/vis absorption and emission spectra is to solve the generalized eigenvalue equation.

In the case of SCF theory, it is commonly referred to as the time-dependent density functional theory or Hartreeâ€“Fock (TDDFT or TDHF) approach. TDHF is also known as the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). 

VeloxChem implements a reduced-space Davidson algorithm to solve the equation for the *N* lowest eigenvalues (bottom-up).

## Complex polarization propagator approach

Absorption spectra are also available from the imaginary part of the complex polarizability, in which case an arbitrary frequency region is specified together with a requested frequency resolution.
